# Overview

Team #2


Our team's final project for CSE 310 is a Student Housing App, which drew inspiration from BYU-I's Housing Web Page. As students at the university, we've observed limitations in the existing platform's ability to provide comprehensive information for students seeking on or off-campus housing.

Our Student Housing App aims to enhance the housing search experience for students, offering a more thorough resource as they seek their "second home" away from home. Key features include property mapping, distance display to the school, and price filtering, among others.
